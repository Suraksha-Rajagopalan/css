                    Water can be used for direct and indirect purposes. Direct purposes include bathing,
                    drinking, and cooking, while examples of indirect purposes are the use of water in
                    processing wood to make paper and in producing steel for automobiles. The bulk of the
                    world’s water use is for agriculture, industry, and electricity. The most common water uses
                    include:

                    <li>Drinking and Household Needs</li>
                    <li>Industry and Commerce</li>
                    <li>Recreation</li>

            <h3>
                Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 is to “Ensure availability and sustainable
                management of water and sanitation for all”. The targets cover all aspects of both
                the water cycle and sanitation systems, and their achievement is designed to
                contribute to progress across a range of other SDGs, most notably on health,
                education, economics and the environment.

                    40 per cent shortfall in freshwater resources by 2030 coupled with a rising world
                    population has the world careening towards a global water crisis. Recognizing the
                    growing challenge of water scarcity the UN General Assembly launched the Water
                    Action Decade on 22 March 2018, to mobilize action that will help transform how we
                    manage water.

            <h3>
                <p>
                    Getting enough water every day is important for your health. Drinking water can
                    prevent dehydration, a condition that can cause unclear thinking, result in
                    mood change, cause your body to overheat, and lead to constipation and kidney
                    stones. Water has no calories, so it can also help with managing body weight
                    and reducing calorie intake when substituted for drinks with calories, such as
                    sweet tea or regular soda.
                </p>
                <b>Water helps your body:</b>
                <li>
                    <ul>Keep a normal temperature</ul>
                    <ul>Lubricate and cushion joints</ul>
                    <ul>Protect your spinal cord and other sensitive tissues</ul>
                    <ul>Get rid of wastes through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements</ul>
                </li>
                <b>Your body needs more water when you are:</b>
                <li>
                    <ul>In hot climates</ul>
                    <ul>More physically active</ul>
                    <ul>Running a fever</ul>
                    <ul>Having diarrhea or vomiting</ul>

                <u>
                Everyone should consume water from foods and beverages every day
                </u>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <h3>
                    Although there is no recommendation for how much plain water everyone should 
                    drink daily, there are recommendations for how much daily total water intake 
                    should come from a variety of beverages and foods. Daily total water intake 
                    (fluid) is defined as the amount of water consumed from foods, plain drinking 
                    water, and other beverages. Daily water intake recommendations vary by age, sex, 
                    pregnancy status, and breastfeeding status.  Most of your fluid needs are met 
                    through the water and other beverages you drink. You can get some fluids through 
                    the foods that you eat—especially foods with high water content, such as many 
                    fruits and vegetables. Drinking water is one good way of getting fluids as it 
                    has zero calories.
